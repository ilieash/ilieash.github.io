My name is ilieash bulbul.

I am a big fan and user of opensource softwares and UNIX like operating systems. I try to use them all the time both personally and professionally. Currently working as a technical support person in a multinational company. Its a mixed OS environment with Winodws and Mac as desktop and Linux and windows as server.

After doing the Bachelor in Information Technology from Federation University Australia, I have started working in the Information technology field. Initially worked as a technician and learned new technologies. One such technology is Unix like operating systems. I had a great interest on this system and begun to implement it on my daily life.

### More Information

I also love watching Documentary, Movies, TV shows, listening to music, discuss about Linux, Android and other technologies. Love playing Cricket and watching most of the sports specially soccer and cricket.
