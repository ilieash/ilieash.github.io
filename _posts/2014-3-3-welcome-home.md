This is the first page i am creating using GIT and Jekyll. The primary goal for this git site is save my work and re-use them when i need them. As i browse through the web when i need some help on configuring a service on my Linux server, i need to make a summery and save it somewhere and this is the best place to do that as i can find it easily when i need it.

I have used a prebuilt Jekyll site named Jekyll-now. thank you very much barryclark for your guide on how to create a jekyll portfolio.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
